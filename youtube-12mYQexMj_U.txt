so there's an analogy between what's
going on in our politics and our culture and the way you might play with a water balloon okay I'll tell you what I mean
grab a water balloon you squeeze it in one spot what happens the water shows up in a different spot squeeze in the other
Critique of Republican politicians for their limited understanding of the culture war.
Spot Great it bulges in the middle it's still the same water there's the same water it just flows to a different place
and we forget that especially Republican politicians more than any other group of
political or cultural actors or leaders on the planet Republican politicians fail to understand that basic principle
when it comes to the so-called culture War what do I mean
they latch on to some solution okay first of all they don't really understand the nature of the cultural
War they just say the words that they're taught to say woke was the last four letter word that they learned and they'll utter it you know until we're
Vivek discusses the rise of the ESG movement and its implications for capitalism.
all blue in the face without having any sense of what it actually means they're like billiard balls you hit it they go in whatever Direction they're hit without knowing why they're even going
in that direction that's much of the Republican establishment but the problem with that approach is
that if the other side is actually understanding how to aim where they're hitting the billiard balls you're always going to be on the losing side of that
game and so that's exactly what's happened in the rise of one of my core topics
over the last year the rise of the ESG movement where we debated through the front door for 35 years 40 years The
Perils of big government when the other side said okay you guys said you like capitalism great we're just going to go
through the back door to get done through your system what you thought you
we couldn't get done through the front door under the Constitution so that's you know we squeeze the water balloon in
one place big government great the water just flows to the part that we weren't paying attention to because we thought
it was our home turf capitalism itself Capital markets itself and it flows over
there now even in the realm of capitalism a lot of friedmanite conservatives what would they say they would say that the CEO of a company
has to carry out the wishes of the shareholders so we would say in 1980 if
the CEO wants to unilaterally impose a political agenda using shareholder money
on whoever his stakeholders or his customers the CEO can't do that because
the CEO reports to the shareholders again what do they do the water just flows to a different place they say okay
okay fine we can play that game we'll just say that we are the shareholders
that is the rise of BlackRock and State Street in Vanguard and Invesco and the rest of the ESG industrial complex that
then shows up as the shareholders of top companies across Corporate America
even though they're not the actual Capital owners why because Republicans latched on to First the free market as
an alternative to government then to shareholder Primacy as the solution within free market
Importance of puncturing the metaphorical water balloon and addressing root issues.
capitalism but again the word shareholder itself becomes co-opted to something the other side's ahead of because they know what they're actually
trying to do while our side mostly consists of a bunch of billiard balls that just go in whatever direction we're
hit it's the other side that's actually doing the aiming okay so what happens it's like a hydraulic pump system it's like a water balloon we keep squeezing
in one place the same Waters in the system what do you have to do you have to puncture the balloon itself you have to drain you have to drain the entire
Emphasizing understanding the "why" behind actions rather than just focusing on the "what."
system of the poisonous water that's in it in the first place that's the only way out you can't play this game of
thinking you're solving one problem and then fetishizing it turning that into a slogan
another one we'll talk about school choice whatever it is the free market without realizing the why why is it that
you're doing what you're doing and I think that's some of the one things we're missing in our movement it's one of the reasons I'm in this race is not
just to ask forget the question of the who not even the what the what is meaningless without understanding the
why you might even be doing the right thing at a given moment but if you don't understand why you're doing it then in
the next moment the thing you're doing is actually going to be the wrong thing because the other side is one step ahead and so whether that's in the rise of ESG
and capital markets or even whether that's in the rise of other ways in which the left is
The role of accreditation bodies in influencing private schools.
praying on the minds of young children not just in public schools but even in private schools through mechanisms that
are invisible today to the conservative movement what happens is you say that okay the public schools with funding
from the Department of Education or otherwise are foisting this woke ideology poisonous race and critical
race and critical gender theory on young children the right way to do that is to achieve school choice I say this is someone I
love the free market and shareholder Primacy as much as the next guy just as much as I love school choice as a step forward but it's not a Panacea
it's not an end-all be-all goal that is a means to the end of achieving a goal and if we treat it as a Panacea what
does the other side do they take over the indirect means of influencing the
Introduction to James Lindsay and their shared intellectual journey.
private schools themselves through say the accreditation bodies
which have to accredit a school in order for that school to be eligible as the recipient for those educational
saving account dollars for those school choice dollars so they're always one step ahead because we're not asking the
question of why it is we're doing what we're doing and I'm joined today by one of the few
people in our movement who actually asks that question
the why okay I I met him before I actually met him I think one of
the best ways to get to know somebody is actually to read a thing they've written my 11th grade English teacher taught me
that if you can't write something down you probably don't know what you have to say she was right about that
but the flip side of that is if you can consistently write down what you think you probably do have a pretty good sense of what you want to say and I first came
across James Lindsay when I read his co-authored book cynical theories I was
impressed and that was the beginning of a journey of my beginning to study his work more and then eventually through
crisscrossing as we traveled the country a few places where we spoke and shared a stage began the beginning of a
friendship and intellectual you know Alliance I would say that hopefully has uh has its best days still ahead of it
and I'm grateful James for you to Flying to Columbus to be with us today on the podcast welcome to the podcast and I'm
looking forward to diving in with you about the why understanding maybe start with
some issues that are near and dear to your heart as it relates to education but some of the same principles
apply to the areas where I've built the last phase of my career in fighting against ESG and you know I think what's
at the heart of both of those is what's really the future the conservative movement all about I think
we're lost in the desert but I think we can find our way to the promised land and it's going to be people like you who
actually have real intellect and real heft and an understanding of why we go through the motions we do that help get
us there so anyway thanks a lot for joining yeah my pleasure it's kind of funny you say lost in the desert
watching the conservative movements grapple with this over the past few years I frequently think of the story of
Moses and exodus going up and finds the burning bush that doesn't get consumed and he talks to the bush and he gets the
Commandments and he comes down and what have they done they built an idol and he's like I'm like yeah the golden calf
I've been gone two weeks two days or whatever what have you done you know and that it's I feel like I watch the
conservative movement make this and I think you put building their golden calf oh no that's all whatever it is one at a time and you put your finger on it
because when you use the water balloon analogy because the left thinks operationally they're
not smarter than conservatives they're obviously not necessarily grounded in reality in fact they're projecting the
reality they want to bring into the world but they're very operational and people on the right tend not to answer
with operational thought they don't understand it what's happening in our society again and again is that water
The importance of operational thinking in addressing societal issues.
balloon sitting out there and the left grabs it right in the middle so both sides bulge and they don't care which
one you decide to play with that's how they're going to exploit you this is a win-win it's a win-win for them that's
James Lindsay on how Antifa provokes law enforcement to create chaos at protests.
right in in the martial arts they would say if you if you don't block you're
getting hit if you do block you're getting thrown they set you up like that it's called mid-level violence
it's a unconventional warfare tactic and they're very good at it they're trained how does that works yeah I am I'm not
touching on you I'm not touching you I'm not touching you is kind of the the standard little kid provocation or
antifa showing up and they got police they're standing there just safeguarding the protest right of course we know with
antifa it's not going to be a protest it's going to be something wild eventually but they have to provoke the
opening to become wild and so what they do is why you got your riot gear we don't see
no riot here why you got your riot gear we don't see no riot here until somebody overreacts they're squeezing the balloon
in the middle and if you don't do anything they get to run roughshod they run over you and if you do respond they
Introduction to the tactics manual "Beautiful Trouble."
carefully frame it out so that you've overreacted they are using strategies and we can we can stay in this martial
arts World a little bit okay to think operationally so that they trick and trap conservatives over and over and
over again it's actually a principle in their literature I don't know if you've seen they have a tactics manual uh everybody should actually look at this
it takes this problem seriously it's called Beautiful trouble you'll hear who who like this is a real book it's a real
book it's also available completely on online for free that I'm not entirely sure like an open source it's an open
source yeah so but you'll hear beautiful beautiful trouble it's at beautifultrouble.org and one of their
key principles well first you'll hear Democratic politicians say it's it's an extension of their their activist
concept of good trouble and you'll hear politicians like AOC or Kamala Harris or so-and-so go up on there and say we're
The principle "Your real action is your target's reaction" and its relation to operational thinking.
going to make good trouble we're going to make good trouble well beautiful trouble is the update to Rules for Radicals from Saul Alinsky for the
digital immediators like a modern version they explicitly say that it is it's an updated
it is and so one of their core principles is that your real action is
your Target's reaction so this is exactly what you're talking about they get you to go ahead and grab
a side of the water balloon that's your reaction and they know how to take advantage it's almost like the Sun Zoo a
little bit of Sun Zoo that's that's what I was gonna say is it really yeah I remember reading that high school it's a
so you're yeah like your real goal what did they say actually I say your your real action is your Target's reaction oh
I love I mean I don't love the way they use it but I love the that you're aware of this that is operational thinking
Comparison of these tactics to Sun Tzu's "The Art of War" and the importance of understanding the opposition's strategies.
they are trying to provoke you into reacting a particular way so they can frame that reaction or use that reaction
to gain their advantage exactly like you said with ESG you know we're gonna go hard hard into free market free market
free market so now we're gonna go ahead and do some corporate communism and capture that from sort of like a feigned
Retreat a little bit yeah as a principle of lead them over there that's ready for understanding their game better than they do themselves and then with other
policies since you brought up uh sunza so um there's a principle in in The Art of
War in chapter seven that where sinza says that if you want to defeat your
enemy you don't surround the whole Army because the Army will fight to the death so you surround them on three sides and
give them a way out when they see he says when they see a path to life they'll take it if you surround them
entirely they'll fight to the death because they see no path to life but they'll take the path to life so if you
give them the path to life they'll take it and that's when you hit them that's when you strike so you surround them on
three sides and then kill him on the fourth as they take the retreat so absolutely you're conditioning their
Danger of underestimating opponents who are more strategic and focused on long-term goals.
Retreat and you can see once you understand that they're things they're doing operational that's exactly what's I mean and that's where what I would say
is I did not have a I and I want to hear more about this I the way I see it I get frustrated watching conservatives
March into that fourth path right they're surrounded by and then they're marching to their death eventually it
ends with the guillotine that's right so when I get frustrated with conservatives you know many people in the presidential race many politicians whatever doing
such a thing going through the motions I didn't have a good sense of the intentionality oh yeah they know
what they're doing yeah we underestimate our opponents to our Peril I again I
don't think they're smarter I don't think maybe they are smarter they're more genetically smarter but like
inherently smarter they are more strategic they have a 50-year or 20-year et cetera agenda they don't want to just
be left alone they want to take over the world and people who just want to be left alone want to do other things and
so they have a very focused and purposed intensity to them so you look at these different things school choice you're surrounded on all sides in the schools
except one and so here becomes the magic held out solution to all your problems
and it becomes a litmus test for conservatives by certain activists that go out and push this idea and so now all
of a sudden you have great conservative legislators at the state level even the federal level getting primaried because they were wrong on this particular issue
that's not how false Idols that's exactly right I mean like I have nothing
against school choice anymore than I have it against the free market but the fetishization right the idolization yeah
Discussion of the "black pill" mentality, representing a fatalistic view of the future.
again and again and again we always are getting surrounded and then we're given only one option oh no they've got every
institution what's left National divorce balkanize the country split up it's the
only thing left it's already too late it's all we can do and they get this doomsday mentality and then hold out a
path to life the so-called black pill and then they are like what does that mean the black pill okay so there's all
those pills right we all have pills now after the Matrix so in The Matrix we'll have to go back for all the normies out there and for the Boomers and so in The
Matrix which came out in like the 90s fun Story by the way how dorky am I the second Matrix movie was the last time I
saw a movie in the movie theater until my family dried me like two years ago it was I just that's it I'm done but um oh
really yeah it's a long time ago it was like 20 years but yeah so Morpheus comes out he's got Neo this is before he gets
taken out of the Matrix for the first time and he tells him the world is not what you think it is here's this pill
it's blue if you take it you go you go to sleep you wake up in your bed you had a weird dream nothing ever happened
here's the red pill you take the red pill and we'll see how deep the rabbit hole goes and in other words we're going to show you the truth and he gets
ejected from the Matrix sees the world wasn't as he thought so the red pill means being awake into reality the blue pill means being conditioned to accept
the uh hyper real or or propaganda uh
what we think about like our normal the pseudo-reality being projected by the media by The Narrative as we as we're
starting to all call it well then there's these other pills that have been coming derivative so does the white pill and the black pill white pill
means you see hope for the future black pill means you see no more hope you're you've gone to Doomsday you're
fatalistic it's all over we've already lost there's nothing we can do um and so a strategic maneuver would be
The importance of not falling into the trap of limited creativity and stepping into pre-set directions.
to get people to feel that way it's called demoralization an actual communist tactic you get people to feel
like there's no hope left that's the freedom of black pill and then you give them a little bit of a white pill by the
way maybe school choice will save us maybe if we balkanize maybe if we have a national divorce we escape these traps
that have been set for us not realizing that stepping in those directions is the
Trap and they're trying to there's a meme that they're exhausting your creativity for other Solutions which is
why I'm really glad you're in this race because you seem to have an inexhaustible amount of that but
they they exhaust your creativity and there's a meme it shows you know some Republicans or whatever and it says
we've tried absolutely nothing and we're all out of ideas and that's where I get
so frustrated they don't know they're getting played operationally they don't know that the left is is you know when
you play pool so you said with the Billiards you don't just I don't I'm not good at it so I just watched some on TV
when I was younger and picked up the idea the goal isn't to hit the ball and put the other ball in the pocket that's
actually not the goal of Billiards if you want to win you have to hit the ball and put the ball in the pocket and make
the cue ball roll so that it sets up your next shot too Yes yes again and
again and again and the left is doing that and the right is not doing that yeah the right the Mind allergies
they're just they are the billiard balls that's what they are that's right I think they're aiming or just thinking
one step at a time that's right that's right yeah and and they these principles of operations are key let's talk about
the school voice example a little bit I mean just for the purpose of you know
using it as an example sure of how this game always evolves one step ahead right
so so the basic thought here and I I could admit I was I was saying stuff like this you know years ago myself
because there's truth to it right you have a centralization problem you
have monopolies on education in the public schools give people the choice combine that with
transparency and there's a couple different objectives we solve for here one is just educational quality on just learning Reading Writing math but
there's this cultural component to this too making sure that you know kids aren't being wrongfully indoctrinated by
poisonous philosophies perpetuated by a centralized body called government we instead Empower those parents to
choose where their kids get to go to school good thing on its face right and what I would say is further pair
that with and this is where I go a little bit further I think it helps is if you pair that with total transparency total transparency Plus
Choice can get you to a pretty good place however what we then see is okay where
Explanation of how accrediting bodies have been captured by proponents of diversity, equity, and inclusion.
now that we have school choice bills passing and becoming the law of the land in States across the country those
parents then have the opportunity to send their kids to any number of accredited
private schools include even Christian Schools what happens then well I mean obviously they capture the accrediting bodies in
fact they've pre-captured the accrediting bodies every professional association in the country more or less
has already captured you're it doesn't matter whether we're talking about uh the nais the National Association of
Independent Schools it doesn't matter if we're talking about the the Christian equivalent um which I just did a thread on Twitter
recently about this how they are completely in on the diversity Equity inclusion program that's your Christian
schools and it doesn't matter if it's you know other accrediting American Bar Association a bar association American
Medical Association uh you name it American physical Union even physics you
know so American mathematical society that I uh you know used to have connection with
um everything these professional societies what's the mechanism of that does that of that takeover sociology uh
I tried to describe this a couple of years ago they know they can't conquer say physics or law directly no way no
way it's certainly not something like engineering you know again a couple more AC what is it Ace and a c s c or
whatever they are the the different ascce so that's what it is sorry the Amer the the engineering accrediting
bodies so they can't how are they going to convince Engineers Engineers by and large are not woke well they don't they
don't come in and change engineering they go in and they say well the conference circuit's very masculine the
conference circuit has a little racism in it the society where we're you know the AMS itself as a mathematical Society
has some issues it seems to be that there aren't enough women here there's not enough diversity or whatever else
race sex gender sexuality whatever it seems awfully exclusive and so they
start twisting the society and what they start doing is a technique that another operational technique which called entryism they slowly find the worst
offenders the people who have actually you know made gaffs or who are actually sometimes a bit of a problem they make
examples of them they end up pushing those people out other people leave and discussed and they bring in people who
are adherent to the ideology so that the community changes when the community gets saturated enough with activists
which doesn't take that many a few percent then they set community guidelines so now to be a member of the society you
have to have these different policies the community guidelines set everything up they dictate who can be and how they're going to be in that society and
then they start asking questions like oh well if the AMS of American mathematical Society was so
toxically masculine or whatever the buzzword happens to be so systemically racist what is it about mathematics that
leads it to be that way what is it about medicine that leads to thank you for I mean I mean you're saying the stuff that
automatically leads to where we are so let's just like walk through the waterfall right I mean let's also be a
little operational about at least the diagnosis here yeah so there's a body
activists are out here swarming around looking for institutions to sort of affect
saying that okay government's over there that's the feigned Retreat okay they went and went and
fight the battle there we got our boring Democratic politicians doing that so let them wage that battle but we're gonna
you know identify what other Frontiers they're necessarily coming to they're
going to come for these private institutions all of which are sort of quasi-governed by these non-profit
accreditation bodies let's go show up and start what picking at their insecurities and leveling accusations
against them that get us a seat at the table yeah maybe that's step one right and start then again that's so important
then they join the boards they they become hired on the staff Etc because the guy who was minding his own business
being some boring professor who is in you know some accreditation body says okay well I'm open to hearing
these ideas great so then they're in the door then they start saying well here's the
results on the base of race or gender or sexual orientation or whatever other
boring criteria they care about and say hey here's the inequity
now what does that say about the discipline itself exactly the basic move right that's
right that's the basic move and you know I like how you set a body and there's the actors who want to affect I'm going
to change the word and say infect and I don't do that cruelly I don't think that we should be well it's their word it's
actually their work they actually have written papers saying that viruses are the ideal metaphor for their approach that they have their ideology and they
have to instill it into people who are going to become professionals but activists at the same
time and they say that the goal taking the virus as their metaphor is to go and infect the new institution would have
been like really biological and Technical about this it's not like just bacteria or anything else to think about a virus
is it co-ops the Machinery of the host itself to propagate more of the virus
Explanation of the Long March through the Institutions strategy and its influence on modern ideologies.
which is different than like a bacteria which is just like okay goes in and yeah you know kills it that's boring or the virus actually has a different way of
working and that pretty much exactly describes what they're doing here that's exactly the only part I didn't know is their own literature actually says these
things which then makes it much more like that's the new thing for me out of this conversation I mean their literature has been suggesting this
technique since the 60s I mean this is what Rudy deutschki called the Long March through the institutions Herbert
Marcus and 72 in his book counter Revolution and Revolt says we need to go in we need to stop being Outsiders we
need to go in and bring our ideology with us and he says at all levels of education and into the computer
programming into everything we're gonna go be the thing we're going to stop resisting and we're going to go be the
thing and subvert from within but then in 2014 two researchers at Arizona State University published a paper and titled
women's studies as a virus and explicitly said the virus becomes the ideal metaphor compare themselves to
favorably to HIV to women's studies itself is a virus yes that then infects
so they co-opts other institutions right they give the example of taking male biology students at the undergraduate
level having them take some women's studies courses to get the ideology into them and then when they go to grad school they can infect the department at
the new college that they go to by bringing the activism to that Social Circle of the graduate student union or
whatever happens to be the biology Department itself and they start leveling these accusations to kind of
infect that new cell to co-opt it so that its cellular Machinery if you will
produces viral that organization and produces more yeah that's exactly their model so let me just like to take the
other side of this for a second um not the other side but just to sort of scrutinize something that
you know may not make sense or if it does make sense it's disappointing is that
the thing they're infecting is still comprised of you would think free autonomous thinking
Discussion on how the "infection" game only works on individuals susceptible to ideological
human beings moral having exactly moral human beings who have their own sense of
agency and virtue and values but this infection
game only works if you have an unhealthy host an unhealthy cell that
was susceptible to infection in the first place and I do feel I mean this is a big part
of the I don't know how much you saw about my candidacy and coming out or whatever but a big part of this is
looking in the mirror and asking ourselves what is that void of purpose
and meaning that leads us to be so susceptible that's right to infection I wonder if that's a question we don't ask
enough well it is because it's what has left us uncertain that our values are good and fine as they are that we don't
have to kind of give into these accusations that through some kind of very Arcane and
esoteric Pathways that we've somehow contributed to or behaved in in secretly
racist ways that we have to hire a consultant to even explain to us in words that we don't even know and pay them and pay them through the eyeballs
to do it yeah uh something has left us insecure in our own values this is why
the answer to woke in the slaying is being based which means being rooted down in your own values so that you
don't get flipped over if you want to use a martial arts analogy they say get based so they can't throw you so you're rooted down in your own values you know
why you have value and why your values are worth having in your that's where
that term comes from I thought it was just like an online slang it's I don't no it is not where it actually comes from that's how I conceptualize it
because of my background in the martial arts when I first I like it though I started thinking about it it's just like Online Slang right yeah I used to do
some Judo and if you don't want to get thrown you have to have bass yeah so we get based so yeah so we get based so
that we don't get we get based on our own values yeah and yeah the antidote to woke is based I like that that's right
it is it really is really in a deep sense is actually it is and because then you're not susceptible to infection
right and these these for people that work in these professional and accrediting and so on bodies very
insecure yeah there's almost a selection bias of the kinds of people it's a good point where
like the host I mean I think I think we should be precise about it I think in the way this works you know push back on
me but the host to me is less often a human being than it is some kind
of apparatus like an organizational apparatus that has a managerial Machinery to it that's right
and I think that sets up for two things one is there's a Machinery to perpetuate the virus the you know let's call the
woke mind virus by analogy here but it also selects for the kinds of
human beings that tend to be on a committee or whatever like let's just think about that for a second I think
they tend to be if you're good at join a committee or whatever what does that say uh over
generalize here but partially generalized what does that say about you means you're devoting time to
a body that makes Decisions by consensus that selects for the kind of human being
who opted to spend their time that way
which in turn says something about their own need for fulfillment and meaning through something that is unlikely to
provide it a committee or a title on that committee or chairmanship or vice chairmanship on some board
that probably is over concentrated for people who are vulnerable to mind Virus Infection well
yeah I think your people I think there's a trait to committee types to committee folk if you will that's also been left
out of that discussion so far which is deferral of responsibility by making
decisions through consensus it's never really your fault we decided I didn't decide we did somebody above me said I
have to somebody below me demanded it so nobody's ever actually responsible for yourself yeah they're not based in their
own accountability or responsibility either and you'll see this when you go to the schools why did you implement this terrible woke policy that's
damaging our kids well the kids demanded it or the superintendent told me I had
to it's never anybody's fault and so since nobody can take her and I you know how do you answer this well who do you
gonna who would you say sue for damages if damages are well nobody's actually responsible so there's no point of
responsibility in in purpose homo confusion or whatever purposeful
diffusion of accountability that's right now this just makes me curious on the sociology of this
I could imagine that now now that you've opened my eyes to this either that too was in their Bibles an intentional plans
the uh what is it uh the the beautiful trouble.org has that Vision you have to
find psychologically insecure managerial diffuse accountability types either they
did it by Design or it was almost by process of elimination that they tried it everywhere the other ones didn't work and it was sort of a natural selection
of these kinds of Institutions which do you think it was uh any evidence that they were this smart on this issue too
well I mean maybe a little bit because communism always tends toward bureaucracies and they occupy
bureaucracy so they know they have tons of advantages in bureaucratic structures but when you're doing mid-level violence
again and again and again the place that just from a kind of a natural selection kind of perspective the place that
you're going to have the largest success rate the targets that you're going to give you the biggest reward for your efforts are always going to be these
kinds of people so people who aren't willing to take a lot of responsibility people who don't want
to be on the hook for things people who have this kind of deferral of responsibility and you know they're
unsure of themselves are the ones mostly that what you're not you're going to be able to do is roll over if you squeeze
it squeeze that water balloon in the middle and you have under react and overreact are the two places the water flows they're the under reactors
so that's that's a lot of bang for very little Buck there's very little risk in
causing somebody to roll over over and over and over again so the selection pressure to Target institutions that
will roll over over and over and over again but I mean there's other actions I
mean it's just more the the nerdy side of me that's trying to find it but uses probably a selection pressure biased
towards because those are the only places that they could manage to infect anyway maybe they have a natural bias
towards an affinity towards bureaucratic settings anyhow because that's that and bureaucratic choke points yeah it's also
James Lindsay talks about the concept of "legitimation by ology" in a post-modern world, highlighting the use of false logic and consensus for validation.
like Leverage right because they can get more they can get more uh effect more juice out of the squeeze if they take
over an entire organization organizations are often run by bureaucrats I mean I don't want to go too into the weeds of post-modern
literature but go for it if we go read and I really should do like a whole discussion on this at some point if I go read Jean Francois leotard wrote the
post-modern condition in 1979. he's not saying that we should live in a postmodern world he's saying what the
post modern world works like and why it's miserable and so one of the things he talks about and he does it wrongly in
my opinion I don't agree with the point he's actually making but he talks about this concept it has this fancy academic name called legitimation by parology and
he says that's what pirology parology parallel logic oh parallel okay fine
fine and so legitimation how do we determine if something's legitimate or valid and he's saying it's occurring in
the post-modern condition that we find ourselves in through false logic but what he actually if you boil it down
Lindsay explains how the left has weaponized post-modern theories and critical theories, using moral consensus to legitimize their ideas.
what he's saying is it's through consensus it's through kind of ginned up consensus and so what you
I have to understand is that the the the left over the past 40 50 years has
figured out how to take these critical theories these post-monetaries and weaponize them so what they know is that if they can create that moral consensus
that social consensus that this is the good thing to do the right thing to do they can falsely legitimize their own
ideas and then that gets the strength of bureaucratic you know or or
administrative or managerial weight behind legitimacy also and it becomes a
and I I always but what was it I want to understand the parallel logic part I didn't follow that part I understand the
managerial legit yeah for leotard is he's just using a big
word to mean consensus okay it's the logic of the group just just creates some kind of group that creates
momentum behind it through groupthink but then the bureaucracy just sort of gives it the imprimatur of also
bureaucratic legitimacy correct and so they know that if they capture things that have monopolies of influence
He highlights how activists strategically target choke points and monopolies of influence, comparing their tactics to wartime strategies.
whether it's over an institution or whether it's over a corporation or whether it's over a government body if
they can capture something as a monopoly of influence then they can influence everything Downstream from that if they
can get that that consensus based or group think based
which is usually morally Twisted to their advantage in the accrediting body
in the licensing body or whatever everything Downstream from that follows and that's the logic that's the the
places that they target we also overestimate by the way how many of these activists it takes to to topple
our society they actually only have to grab a number of Choke points we're talking you know a few thousand as
opposed to with What four out of seven people on each board we're not talking about needing you know 52 or 60 percent
of the population very few people just strategically hitting those choke points so they thinking operationally no if you
were if we're in war right if this is World War II we'd be looking at oh we've got to do something with that bridge
we've got to do something with that factory we've got to do because this is where they're building their tanks this is how they deliver their materials this
is how we disrupt our supply chain they're saying what's the supply chain for the intellectual and cultural property of the of society let's control
that let's take that and that's these accrediting bodies and so on and then sadly though since we got here by school
choice just to kind of circle it back to that so we don't lose it the accrediting body part is only one small part of that
The conversation ties ESG and school choice together, emphasizing the importance of thinking at scale and fighting back legally when necessary.
issues kind of three-sided trap with the strike on the outside
the solution itself or the appearance of a solution breeds complacency that's that will to live instead of to fight so
rather than suing your kid's school for harming them now you're thinking I'm just gonna go somewhere else I'll
vote with my feet I'll just leave the problem and walk away from it which is a tendency conservatives way too often
have they're harming your kids fight back legally and also and also you have you're paying your taxes that actually
fund that school and you have voting rights that go along with it and this is where these two issues that you brought
up that are kind of parallels where they tied together though where where ESG and
school choice become the same issue because conservatives also have this tendency to think outside of scale
that's right they do not think of scale they pick you talk to the school choice Advocates and they say I could open a
micro school yeah that's cool a micro school it's micro that's right
where are the scaling factors going to be it's going to be large corporations what Corporation is going to be able to
scale to build you know a significant portion of Market capture without being
ESG compliant right now and that s and ESG is code towards the EI of course so
it's all coming in the environmental program everything's coming so let me let me just just uh I know you follow this but just to explain the
ESG aspect of this in detail yeah like it's a great parallel where school
choice and ESG or the divestment the counter divest movement is the
equivalent of the school Choice Movement which is oh well I don't like that Disney's
behaving this way or fill in the blank Chevron Apple adopting a racial Equity
audit whatever it is I'm just gonna sell my Disney stock or my Apple stock or my Chevron stock or
whatever okay and put it where exactly
in Paramount Pictures is that that much better or in Exxon or in Microsoft is
that that much better to Apple or Disney or Chevron oh well what's going on there well then I'm just going to remove my
money from the market and then do what's a new startup Disney a new startup Microsoft so that's like
the divest movement and by the way every time you divest this in the Market's here
what does that mean it means you're selling your share to somebody else who's buying it at an incrementally lower price because you're selling it
that's right versus recognizing that actually if you own a share of a company
there's three things that come with that one is the financial entitlement the right to receive the dividends the future profits that that company pays
out but the second is a vote is a vote voting right you have the right to vote your shares and the third is a voice
that you get to informally exercise as your shareholder that's backstop by your vote
so why would you sell that in virtue of no alternative really right versus
engaging to maximize the value of your investment which means purging these toxic values that are otherwise in the
boardroom using your voice and vote to do it now I I think I think who's who's the other person buying your share most
of the time by the way for a better price yeah right because The Profit Stream is still the same they're just getting it for a lower price because
you're selling it I think you know this this was the whole premise behind my founding strive yes right so strive's
whole point was not playing the divestment game which virtuous as that might sound has
literally no effect at best but instead to use shareholder
engagement to actually drive change at the companies like Disney and Chevron
and apple all three of whom to last year back when I was running strive
wrote direct shareholder letters to and actually hopefully they're driving consequent changes in corporate Behavior
it's kind of the same analogy with respect to public schools and school choice I think the school choice pieces
I think at least a little more defensible than divesting from a company in a liquid Capital Market it is literally
infinitesimally tiny that's the zero impact by selling a share yeah yeah we're a school choice you know I think
is no no impact but there's a great parallel between there is a great parallel this this tendency to divest to
walk away from trouble rather than to turn around and confront trouble uh the school shouldn't be abusing your kids
and the corporation or the the banks I should say that the big investment firms should not be doing impact investing
with your money that you don't really want them doing so if you decide you're
just gonna walk away you're just going to walk and walk and walk until you're in the ghetto uh you know not a literal
well maybe but probably not a literal ghetto but you're going to ghettoize yourself by stepping away from the problem and it's going to gobble up more
of the more of the the territory and give you less and less and less until you're in your uncomfortable and happy
little corner of the world and they have all the spoils um
but that issue of scale matters with school choice because we have to understand that most of the
market will not go to micro schools and it's not even necessarily here about accrediting and it's not necessarily
even about um whether or not the government will change its mind down the road and put
strings that weren't necessarily there which by the way they always do it's actually about the fact that the
largest sector of the market the the market capture is going to go very heavily to large firms that are going to
be ESG compliant and so you're not act if you're reasoning for school choice as a principal desire for academic freedom
go ahead support it if your reason is I want options to get my kid out of woke schools you're you're walking in you've
got to know the why that's right you've got to know the why rather than just going through the motions
what's your sense of whether most Republican politicians who out of the words school choice are
thinking about the why or not I don't think most of them are and I think that
that's really unfortunate and I don't think they more importantly and I hate to just
drag it back to ESG but ESG is so important I don't think they understand I think that there's so much kind of
old I know you always bring up the 1980s thought about the market the market the
market that they don't realize that we're actually operating under we're operating under a cartel of course we do
not operate in a market with Market competition we have every large corporation is beholden it's an
ideological ESG they're chasing after their corporate equality index score and doing all these crazy things uh I just
actually ran into an example somebody reached out to me from a geha one of a
large insurer in Kansas City Missouri and they are actually giving workplace
trainings to get their employees to go and Lobby the state legislature write
your legislators here are the Bills here are the things these are anti-lgbt and our view blah blah blah it's not even
like lobbying for their to get like on government contracts or something no which is cronyism which I don't love either but that's a separate point it's
not even these politics for us and I don't know that it's specific but last year the company or whoever
it's pronounced geha signs on to the corporate equality index starts putting on their website how proud they are that
they got their score up to a 90 it goes up to 100 they're chasing that number and that number
in many Industries and many companies come they they send people from the Human Rights Campaign publishes it they
come in and they tell you these are the activist demands you have to do and if you do them we'll let you keep or raise
your score but that first part's really dirty right we'll let you keep your score if you do all this new stuff that's an extortion Racket and that's
what's actually running this market so when you look at an issue like school choice and you realize large corporate
franchise of things that look like charter schools are going to fill most of the market they're going to be under that same
thumb when you look at the insurance Market they're under that same thumb so there I say for example there's no
school choice in an ESG economy there's no free market under an ESG economy
therefore there can be no free market school choice under an ESG economy and I don't think Republicans are thinking
this way because when I've sat down and talked with Republican lawmakers in DC and at State levels both but especially
the ones in DC I was frequently the first person to broach the concept of ESG to them and
how ESG actually works and how much power oh believe you me yeah yeah and like just we're talking last year and
they're like I've never heard of that and you know what oh no the biggest influence that state elected officials
or or you know in the executive branch certainly have on the culture is through
the hundreds of billions collectively tens of trillions of dollars
that they invest that's right and if they don't know yeah they can't be thinking of the why would
you be doing it it's the why precedes the how so yeah I know the how you can't I don't know why and then some people
try to skip to the how without ever understanding the word or the why which is much of what you see exactly in the GOP today that's part of why I'm in this
race man yeah I think people just have to start to think I mean well Sue will fight to the death over Ronald McDaniel
or somebody else or Kevin McCarthy or somebody else without actually asking the question of what the heck it is
we're trying to advance why we stand for it and then get to the question of who and how but um but you know we're going
in that order and and yeah you know in in this campaign that's why I'm thrilled to be here and thrilled you're doing
this because but it's interesting how you think about I mean school choice or ESG it's just
they're just examples that's right the broader superstructure a broader trend
you know now they're already changing the name I mean one of the one of the versions of the water balloon squeeze is
then they change the name which is also something that of course frequently comes up right so now ESG right when
Vivek points out that companies and institutions are rebranding ESG as "sustainable finance" in response to criticism.
thanks to efforts of people like yourself you know I I believe I played some some part in this in the last
couple of years have highlighted awareness of ESG as an issue right when guess what BlackRock
many of the blue States along with them have stopped calling it ESG they're
going to change it to sustainable Finance that's right of course yeah and so then it's that feigned Retreat again
okay we get them to go down the direction of a three-letter acronym and then we say that's not fill in the blank
of three letter acronym that's not ESG sound familiar that's not CRT yeah it's
James and Vivek discuss how CRT proponents use the same tactics, denying its presence in schools and instead claiming they are practicing "culturally relevant teaching."
the same thing and and then because because you're fighting an opponent who worships the golden calf that's right
who's an idol worshiper who's a slogan reciter great get them to recite the slogan take the slogan out from under
them make them look like a fool and then you actually capture the castle same game and CRT in schools I mean you
know this story well maybe you should tell it but that's exactly the whole game they played as critical race Theory it's in schools it's in schools and
schools and then kind of use slightly different language say it's not Kimberly Crenshaw or Derek Bell and okay fine
you're not citing Derek Bell to a third grader yeah they're against critical critical race there is oh that's not
critical race Theory Checkmate we win yeah and conservatives don't know exactly why they're going through the motions they lose yeah it's culturally
relevant teaching it's not that you just walk through that you've seen you know that Journey as well as I do if not
better so yeah it's really straightforward they have the name they change the name a little bit or they have another thing that it's embedded
within in this case they we said you know you got CRT going on in schools actually we said you're teaching CRT and
they pulled a technicality on us no no we're not teaching CRT we're not teaching that's a law school topic
that's you know that's Advanced graduate it's only a few seminars in fact we don't have enough of it in law schools we need more of it
and so then but then how would we be teaching third graders that well the fact is that they're not actually
teaching CRT so they aren't lying they're practicing CRT with children they're teaching children to practice
They mention Greta Thunberg receiving an honorary doctorate of theology, reflecting the religious nature of climate activism.
CRT as a religion really as a mode a world view of seeing the world uh
relatedly by the way I don't know if you just saw in the news that Greta thundberg I know it's climate rather than CRT but these are all these
religions that you talked about they just gave her an honorary doctorate of theology well that's accurate it's actually it's
completely accurate I I don't have a problem with that um anyone who invents a new cult that's
James emphasizes that CRT is the operative concept behind culturally relevant pedagogy and that understanding this connection requires diligent research.
lasted more than 10 years or even Pioneers one I don't mind them being recognized as
theologists well that's right because that's exactly what it's a practitioner that's exactly what she is she's the
Joan of Arc our modern Jean dark here yeah that's wonderful but yeah so then they come up with something else CRT is
being the vehicle that was moving it into the schools was called culturally relevant teaching or culturally relevant
pedagogy so they say no no we're just doing this other thing and now you have to go read a bunch of papers and learn a
bunch of new terms and it's a lot of syllables and nobody wants to take the time and it is intentionally confusing
to realize that CRT is the operative thing that makes the CRP work which is
exactly the thing you were accusing them of in the first place and they just played this kind of shell game and then it changes to well it's just honest
history it's just these nice sounding things and that's what we see with this ESG now oh no it's sustainability investing what we should be calling is
impact corporations they're not s Corps they're not C Corps because they aren't serving individual proprietor or
shareholder value they're impact corpse that's right there's actually there is B Corp well
these Corps should not say have all the Privileges that the other Corps have judgment rule for example applies as the
Assumption in court behind you okay yep there's yeah it's like chapter three in there it's like I read your book or
something to go to people's sleep no no but exactly you actually raise a really good point though because
the existence of a b Corp which Patagonia reorganized
itself into a similar kind of form of Corporation is the exception that proves the rule
that if that had to be a separate legal category either it was totally
Superfluous which is not a way you generally read laws or that you believe that law that law
exists for a reason to create that separate category of Corporation because all the other ones had a different
constraining principle and the constraining principle is that you stay out of advancing the political agendas that
are best left to the Civic sphere of Our Lives and so what do they do but it's this one
step aheadism that's right where they say that oh no no no no no even though we said for years and they did
that businesses have to earn their social license to operate that if government leaders won't step up
to address global climate change and Global inequity then Business Leaders must do it instead even though they said
that like 24 months ago yeah when called out on this distinction that's right
we'll say silly you you don't realize that we're
just talking about long run shareholder value that's right they captured long run the shareholder value infiltrated
and undermined the concept of fiduciary responsibility and then they created the conditions so that it in some perverted
weird sense that nobody really means it is your fiduciary responsibility to do all of the ESG stuff because otherwise
BlackRock will crush you which is not responsible behavior to get crushed by the way but what they've done is they've
captured this thing so if we were to force them to identify as a kind of corporation that they are to use their
favorite I word I identified yeah they're B Corps I guess that identify as
yeah it's actually kind of funny actually and so they're trans corpse and and but things like you know these
different privileges like again the business judgment rule which assumes that they are pursuing maximum shareholder return
doesn't apply necessarily to other types of Incorporated uh entities so there are
solutions here there or we could turn and fight and there are ways to beat them at these tricks when but you must
understand how they're doing them now we talk about changing the names though I'll just point out words like sustainable and inclusion they're pretty
married too I don't think they're easily going to get away from sustainability and inclusion and those words have a
long pedigree in their literature as well I mean they can make up new words but it is called you know the United
Nations has a sustainable development goals the GG yeah they're they're a
little married to that that's kind of everywhere it's kind of on everything um but that actually if you don't know
just for people who don't realize this because this is my typical job isn't to just speak about these is to read the
old literature this was the question that was being asked in the 1960s by the the neo-marxist thinkers Herbert Marcus
and is very famous very influential book but millions of people read in the 60s called one-dimensional man if you read
the second ninth chapters you can kind of see what he's doing he's saying that capitalism and socialism are kind of
they're more like Brothers than they are you know two enemies
and they are each doing things that are right so if we could somehow mix them together we could somehow get the
protect the productive capacity of capitalism without sacrificing the ideology and the humanism of socialism
we could somehow but which can't produce if we could somehow mix them together so we'd have a productive socialism on the
one hand and we would have a sustainable capitalism because that's what he says is wrong with capitalism it's not that
it doesn't deliver the goods he says explicitly in his own words it does deliver the goods it delivers a better life but not a socialist life and so
what you have to do is figure out what's wrong with it and what's wrong with it it's not sustainable it will burn itself out it will exhaust the world's
resources it will you know create false needs upon false needs upon false needs and forever Chase its own tail and
eventually run us all dry so if you could somehow make capitalism be
sustainable it would be very much like a productive socialism and you could merge the two
systems and I think that that's exactly the road map that we followed for 50 years without people realizing since
1964 so we're getting on 60 years without people realizing that's what's happened I think they pioneered it in China I think they opened up capitalist
markets in a socialist environment so they could start experimenting with how to blend the systems and what did you
what does it look like China looks very productive it seems to be producing it seems to be delivering the goods you got
crazy Rich Asians Chinese billionaires and oligarchs all over the place money coming at a eight-figure check no big
deal here you go you know they've got it seems to be working they seem to have productive socialism so what does the
West have to do now well we have to look at that we have to learn from that and what do we need to do well we need to be more sustainable we need sustainable
capitalism how do we manage that with stakeholders who understand sustainability Theory so we'll create a
council of stakeholders and and do sustainable Theory from there and tell the corporations how they have to work
and ESG was created this way the world economic Forum says explicitly Klaus
Schwab in his book last year the great narrative for a better future it's hard to not say that with a German accent
says you know what his name of his book was this is a great reset for a better future yeah no it's a great reset for a
bit no the great narrative sorry the greatest thing before covet 19. that's right well this is the subtitles The
Great reset book two oh I see it but the great narrative is there's always a great reason it was a conspiracy theory
oh yeah obviously with a start date announced by the now King of England you know yeah total what a conspiracy theory
it has an official start date unbelievable but but the uh the book The
Great narrative is there's all these existential crises so we need Global cooperation centered under our control
of course to solve these problems and he says how are we going to do it well with the corporations and with the governments we're going to create
public-private Partnerships ah and we're going to enforce them with ESG and he
says well some people won't want to do that so how are we going to get around that well we're going to take the younger generation and we're going to
instill these new values in them through education so that they will demand ESG compliance out of their
corporations that they work for that they buy from the accreditation bodies and Meanwhile we're going to rewrite the
social con contract to be sustainable and inclusive for a better future and
that's what his three-part plan is to to find the three parts the uh the tops
down ESG stakeholder capitalism stakeholder capitalism that's right bottom up is going to be the educational system to transform the younger
Generations so they've got Supply top down they're going to create demand bottom up and then meanwhile they're
going to rewrite the social fabric he spends a lot of time in the book for Klaus on rewriting the social fabric a
new social contract that we all agree to the name of that we've got ESG and the education system it's called social
emotional learning is the tools are using to do this but the name social emotional learning that's right
brainwashing and so the name though for the social contract is global citizenship those are the three big
targets right now Global Citizens citizenship social emotional learning and ESG are the three big targets of
this agenda and you can understand how they work together because Klaus lays it out in a few paragraphs in the middle of
uh the great narrative for a better future top down bottom up and then rewrite the
inside out of society put you a call sorry the middle the Battleground or the the the intermediating glue ESG social
emotional learning and then you'd call it global citizenship ah yeah and you know how global citizenship is defined
first of all it's a nonsense term let me just say that is you have a citizen of a Nation I'm not a citizen that's right citizenship is a relationship between a
ruler and the subjects there's no relationship between any Global body between an individual and a nation until
you will want into existence to make good on the deal people believe they've already made see how they trick you they
get you to believe yourself a global citizen say well what do I get for that and they'll say oh we'll set up a governing body that gives you what you
get and then they explicitly tell you that global citizenship this isn't a book called global citizenship education I just read they tell you well it's not
that interested in rights right it's actually interested in responsibilities what your responsibilities are but a
global citizen in global citizenship education which is pushed heavily and funded heavily through the U.N
is explicitly supporting the 17 sustainable development goals that's how you define a global citizen so we're
going to raise our children to be Global Citizens with a new social contract in some document cholesterol I mean we
win the U.N it's all through the U.N if you if you spend a few minutes looking up global citizenship education and just
read any of the mind-numbing problem that they put out about it you'll see again and again and again that what it
means to be a global citizen is to be compliant and in pursuit of the 17 sustainable development goals of
conspiracy theory agenda 2030. um and so that's how they're defining it and what do they teach in say social
emotional learning well one of the five cap five core competency areas they teach is responsible decision making
well how do you know if you're being responsible in your decision making well are they meeting the 17th sustainable it's pretty nefarious I mean even one of
the things you probably saw some of this so my experience with Claus Schwab never met him uh but my only experience
experience with the world economic Forum was being contacted by them to either attend the conference in Davos which I
have never done and no I'm just doing and then being extended the offer to
become one of their young global leaders I turned it down I said no I don't think
it's a good fit they said you may be a good opportunity to promote your upcoming book I was like my upcoming book is called woking and it takes
direct aim at this Edition so I don't think that's a good fit no thank you months later
I get the announcement oh I don't get the announcement I got a bunch of text messages congratulating me from like random
people I've haven't like seen in like years I saw you made the young global leaders list I'm just like are you kidding me that's really funny there you
are on the website right and there I am on the website mid-level violence and turns out Elon Musk had the same experience Glenn Beck has had the same
experience it's sort of this and and the funny thing is so I then declare for president United States and then a bunch
of people from really our movement or at least people who are I'm grateful
interested in the ideas that you and I have been trying to educate the public on for the last five years
are saying what how could that be you're a young Global fellow no you're actually you're actually a plant you're actually
some sort of Trojan Horse in in a certain way this is how Klaus
Schwab and the likes of them play the game is they're going to exercise Dominion one way or another I grabbed
the middle of the balloon exactly grab the middle of the balloon and then and then and then we fall for it yeah and then we fall for it our people fall for
it we all fall for it so I mean I'm glad the people uh in the movement are attentive to that and care about
absolutely now absolutely but on the other hand but they're being exploited one step ahead yeah exactly right so now
we get somebody who I mean I don't say that I'm not boasting about myself it's just I've made it the objective of my
career to take this on and what do they do they make sure they kneecap the
person who's best positioned to do that because they're always one step ahead that's right and they're like the same move from calling ESU called sustainable
great you're going to get a Warrior from your side who's actually the biggest risk to take us on we're going to
actually undermine the support you give them by actually wrapping the veneer of exactly the young Global leader around
them that's right and it's amazing it's just another example of one step aheadism that the other side has
mastered and I'm not upset at our people for being skeptical we should be if we've learned
one thing about the last 10 years about this infection complex
so you got to be skeptical skepticism is the only way out but in the same way they co-opted the free market itself now they've co-opted
skepticism yeah exactly I wonder if that's in the plan too probably is
probably somewhere in there yeah I mean they they are very operational and if people don't take anything else away
from from our our dialogue today they've got to understand that the left is operational they are thinking in terms
of strategic operations and unless we think in terms of answering those strategic operations understanding them
then we can't typically this can be done merely merely by pointing out that a an
operation is occurring and B as an objective and this is what it is if you say they are manipulating you and here's
their objective that's enough to break the spell for large numbers of people that will then not fall for it will not
go along with it it's like if I did a magic trick if I pull out deck of cards I actually saw an Instagram reel the other day I'm very relatable uh where
the guy was showing the magic trick from his side it's one where you tear the corner off of the card and what it is is
he's got the torn Corner already in the Box I'm not supposed to tell how magic tricks work and he he's flipping up the
next card because the corner is missing and then he finally gets to the place and he does the whole thing and he
tricks this you know poor person into thinking that if you know how the trick works though it's not magic anymore it's
ruined it's over for you and what they're doing are these magic tricks one step ahead of them is actually them
doing a magic trick if they can get you to fight about whether you are a young Global leader now you're fighting about
totally and they're making a strategic advance in another Direction um again divide and conquer is just
another another part of the tactic of staying one it's the one step ahead is it well it's like Flatline two-dimensional total three-dimensional
they keep you fighting down here on the table while they're playing in three dimensions they play in 3D in advance and and if you got your science you can
do the right hand rule I got made fun of on the internet for saying it works like electric current you get the magnetic
field going in a circle the electric current goes perpendicular to it and the current is the flow of their activism so
when you can understand that and say wait a minute I see where this is going I unders understand why you're doing
this I understand for example the drag queen Story Hour while it might middle of the balloon it might roll over a
bunch of kids it might allow us to do whatever it is that the you know obvious direct purpose of it is the other end of
the balloon is it's a provocation and if we can trigger an act of violence as retaliation to this problem exactly what
they do then they're going to exploit the violence and they know that sooner or later they're going to get that I called that kind of hilariously
operation drag Floyd to try to spark a George Floyd moment in the country by
creating a martyr by provoking the violence that they'll then they'll probably sacrifice one of their own wow
yeah of course well I mean they're ultimately their philosophy is based on Hegel and Hegel said history uses people
and then discards them and so yeah sacrificing for your for the movement is exactly your purpose upon sacrifice yeah
that's right yeah Pawn sacrifice makes it even even worse but they know if you can say here's the point though the point is and
then what did what would you do I put this out Media Matters wrote an article about me I said it on a stage at turning
point and America Fest we were both there last year and uh I I said it on stage before I got off stage the article
was already published that fast I got back to my room and found it later that night somebody sent it to me in the the
time stamp I was still on stage unbelievable so they reacted to this very quickly uh and then all these
articles started to come out about it and what did every article say Elon Elon Musk let these people back on
Twitter Elon Musk let these people back on Twitter Elon Musk let these people back on Twitter Libs of tick tock blah
blah me Matt Walsh whoever the characters are let's these people who say this transphobic stuff anti-drag
stuff anti-lgbtq hate they lets them on Twitter so you know their target their
target isn't me their target isn't Libs of tick tock their target is Elon Musk and Twitter the target is to regain
control over social media space they've lost control of they if you learn to read what they're saying operationally
it can shut down their operation in advance and if the right it takes
discipline it takes thinking on the time scales of history and it takes time scales of the next 10
minutes I'm you know that's big stuff it takes bothering to take the time to
read their words I tell people a lot of times if I have a superpower it's one and only
one is I read their literature and believe them when they say we want a revolution I believe they want a
revolution when they say we're going to be like viruses and infect institutions I believe they're going to act like
viruses and infect institutions when they say we're going to go into the thing and carry our idea I believe they
are when they say we're going to use top down and bottom up and rewrite in social contract Inside Out tactics to transform
the society I believe that that's actually what they intend to do um and I get called naive for this but I
don't think that it's naivety I think it's it's key so reading how they think learning that they think operationally
putting those two things together you don't have to read a lot of it you don't have to go back and read a hundred thousand articles this is doable people
can do this educate yourself listen to even people like you at least who are fronting the workload that's right at
least allow this to push that out I mean I've I have a book coming out later this year on ESG just because it hasn't been written yet right a proper book on this
so it's coming out actually probably the next couple months their ideology is not actually complicated which means if you learn a little bit of it these moves
these operational steps are predictable you can get them and it's this is not it's not rocket science they're putting two dots down in the third dot at the
point of the triangle you can guess where pretty close to where it's going to be once you learn kind of how they
think you figure out what the two dots are it's like I said you come out with this operation drag Floyd narrative they
flip out they write a bunch of Articles complaining and saying I'm obviously like this terrible character trying to
discredit what I've said so people won't pay attention to it but every article mentions Elon Musk
they're they're showing their hand these people are playing poker with their cards turned backwards and nobody you
know the right way totally God bless them is like well it would be impolite to look at their cards right right right right well no they're they're showing
you the cards let's let's actually take them at their word I like that you know James it's really interesting on these
topics from critical theory to you know ESG to the infection of capital markets the
March through the Long March through the institutions it's rare that I'll sit down and have a
conversation and and be uh on the learning end of it but that's why
I brought you here because you're one of the people who's actually been at the Forefront of this even longer than I have and your Insight remains at the
bleeding edge even still and so you know this is going to be hopefully something that you and I continue we didn't
actually even get to touch a topic that I think you and I have an interest in so we'll save that for next time which is China's role or the dynamic with China
and how that codependent relationship Works between the neo-marxist left in
the United States and the you know let's just say maoist Marxist objective in in history
China so we'll we'll bookmark that for I will say one thing on that though yeah because it's so critical we're a very
very large risk right now that China everybody's starting to wake up to the
fact that China's not necessarily our friend they're not necessarily our friend yeah understatement is a is a
gift um they also control a very large amount
of our primary manufacturing including course essential things and so so now this is the economic store dynamically
is hanging over our neck right exactly and so we have this kind of Awakening I'm seeing on the conservative oh well
we've got to start bringing back essential manufacturing primary Manufacturing ladies and gentlemen under the ESG
economy you will not are you too expensive and it's too prohibited and it's against every possible regulatory
violation totally imagine the ESG economy is preventing us exactly these things that's right and here this is the
one where I know like you've been you've been taking them at their word I play the same principle to the Chinese this
is part of a long plan put into motion decades half a century ago and it is
working and it has worked probably deserves a hour plus discussion on its own so if you're open to it let's do
that yeah actually because I think that's in one where people need to understand and see the essence of what's happening and I'll tell you one of the
one of the reasons I'm in this presidential campaign is to create the counter framework okay on one hand the
counter to ESG engagement on the economy the counter to the social emotional learning engagement on the schools it's
an opting out ain't going to be just a sole Way Forward you have to change the institutions of scale from within
there's no easy way out other than through but in the middle the pathway of global
citizenship and this is the essence of the political campaign of this that's right is actually the Revival of capital
c citizenship itself the idea that I am a proud citizen of this nation and it so
happens that this nation our nation America is the nation that actually has
the ideals that make us based and I think that if the opposite of woke is
based then the opposite of woke is actually America in the essence of what
we stand for ourselves and that's why you know I've become I wasn't always this way but I've become an Unapologetic
American nationalist around the ideals that Define what America was
born on in the first place it's not something we need to apologize for I think it's actually going to be an
important part of our way out so that's what this that's what this whole Project's about and uh I think you get that better than most
yeah absolutely we've got to realize that americanism American values the
American founding experiment the American focus on taking responsibility instead of expecting somebody else to do
it for us is the American dependence on Merit as you
often point out is the exact opposite of woke it is the exact opposite of what's
being pushed on us from all of these different forces and it is the path out of this next time they tell you to
Define woke do it then tell them to Define merit you get a blank stare in response
well there's the opportunity in the path to our own version of offense prey on that vacuum actually fill that vacuum
I think that's the way forward and we're trying to do that I think we're going to so anyway man thanks thanks for coming and uh to be continued on the China
front in a few weeks yeah absolutely I'm Vivek ramaswami candidate for president
and I approve this message paid for by the vague 2024.
